# Smart-Irrigation-System-using-Arduino
This project has been done as a part of my studies at BTH. The main objective of this is to develop a system which can be able to limit 
the usage of resources such as water, electricity and to maintain soil fertility in the field of irrigation. This project is affordable
and applicable to smaller areas. This project reduces the human interference in the field.

The system is developed using the Arduino, the soil moisture sensor, temperature sensor and the light sensor. The system monitors the presence
of amount of moisture in the soil, the temperature and the brightness of the light present at the field.
